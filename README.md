# CareerPath

My name is Greg Bullington. I am currently learning the skill set to become a Full Stack Software Developer. I really enjoy problem solving and the challenges 
that you face when trying to solve those problems. I really enjoy making things work and finding out why they dont as it requires you to stop and think through 
the process of somethings function. 
I enjoy Coding, Gaming, and building/working on vehicles. I really got my first taste of coding when I was in middle school. 
Working with the BYOND software building out MMORPG games with my friends I really aquired a drive to learn more and work with the different languages.
